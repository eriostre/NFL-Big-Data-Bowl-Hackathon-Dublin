# NFL Big Data Bowl 2023 – Linemen Body Type & Performance Analysis

This repository contains my submission for the **NFL Big Data Bowl 2025 Dublin Hackathon**, focused on the relationship between **linemen body type (height, and weight)** and their performance on passing plays.

## Project Overview
In NFL passing plays, success often depends on the hidden battles between offensive and defensive linemen.  
This analysis connects **physical traits** (height, weight) to **pass protection and pass rushing outcomes**, using the Big Data Bowl 2023 dataset.

### Highlights
- Offensive linemen are significantly heavier than defensive linemen.
- Each lineman position has a distinct body-type archetype.
- Heavier OL tend to allow fewer pressures; lighter DL tend to create more pressures.
- Four key visualizations demonstrate these patterns.

## Repository Contents
- `analysis_notebook.ipynb` – Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis code and visualizations.
- `report.docx` – Written report (under 500 words) summarizing the findings and including the four graphs.
- `figures/` – Graphs generated from the analysis (PNG format).

**Note:** The raw NFL and PFF data files from the Big Data Bowl are **not included** in this repository due to competition licensing. See below for instructions to obtain the data.

## Data Source
This analysis uses data from the **[NFL Big Data Bowl 2023](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/nfl-big-data-bowl-2023)** competition on Kaggle.  
To reproduce the analysis:
1. Sign in to Kaggle and accept the competition rules.
2. Download the CSV files (players.csv, plays.csv, pffScoutingData.csv, tracking_weekX.csv, etc.).
3. Place them in a `data/` directory in this repository.
4. Update the file paths in the notebook if necessary.
