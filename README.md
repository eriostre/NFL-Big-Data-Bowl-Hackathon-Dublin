# NFL Big Data Bowl 2023 â€“ Linemen Body Type & Performance Analysis

This repository contains my submission for the **NFL Big Data Bowl 2023 Hackathon**, focused on the relationship between **linemen body type (height, weight, BMI)** and their performance on passing plays.

## ðŸ“„ Project Overview
In NFL passing plays, success often depends on the hidden battles between offensive and defensive linemen.  
This analysis connects **physical traits** (height, weight, BMI) to **pass protection and pass rushing outcomes**, using the Big Data Bowl 2023 dataset.

### Highlights
- Offensive linemen are significantly heavier than defensive linemen.
- Each lineman position has a distinct body-type archetype.
- Heavier OL tend to allow fewer pressures; lighter DL tend to create more pressures.
- Four key visualizations demonstrate these patterns.

## ðŸ“‚ Repository Contents
- `analysis_notebook.ipynb` â€“ Jupyter notebook containing the full analysis code and visualizations.
- `report.pdf` â€“ Written report (under 500 words) summarizing the findings and including the four graphs.
- `figures/` â€“ Graphs generated from the analysis (PNG format).

**Note:** The raw NFL and PFF data files from the Big Data Bowl are **not included** in this repository due to competition licensing. See below for instructions to obtain the data.

## ðŸ”— Data Source
